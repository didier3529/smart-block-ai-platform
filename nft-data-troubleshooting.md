# NFT Data Troubleshooting Summary

## Overview of the Issue
The application is displaying mock NFT data instead of real data from Alchemy API, despite having a valid API key configured in `.env.local`.

## Current State
As shown in the screenshots, the application is displaying NFT collection data but it appears to still be mock data rather than real-time data from Alchemy.

## Configurations Checked

### API Key Configuration
- `.env.local` contains a valid Alchemy API key: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=YPiVEE9dZ979sTPWBnAkdB8CZohZsJkL`
- Network is properly configured: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHEREUM_NETWORK=mainnet`

### Attempted Fixes

1. **NFT Service Configuration (First Attempt)**
   - Updated the NFT service to use the API key from environment variables
   - Modified error handling to provide better logging
   - Result: Still showing mock data

2. **Environment Variables Update (Second Attempt)**
   - Tried to update environment variables to use demo API key as fallback
   - Added stronger validation for API key presence
   - Result: Authentication errors (401: "Must be authenticated!")

3. **Hard-coded Demo API Key (Third Attempt)**
   - Changed NFT service to always use the Alchemy "demo" API key:
   ```js
   const settings = {
     apiKey: "demo", 
     network: Network.ETH_MAINNET
   };
   ```
   - Forced hasValidApiKey to true to ensure it attempts to fetch real data
   - Result: Still using mock data, possibly fetching but not displaying properly

4. **Data Flow Debugging (Fourth Attempt)**
   - Added debugging logs in NFTMarketOverviewStats component
   - Added logs in NFTEvaluationModule component
   - Fixed broken `useNftCollections` hook that was returning empty mock data:
   ```js
   queryFn: async () => {
     // This was returning empty mock data
     return {
       collections: [],
       totalItems: 0,
       totalPages: 0,
       currentPage: 1,
       pageSize: 10,
     };
   }
   ```
   - Changed to use real service:
   ```js
   queryFn: () => getNftCollections(filters)
   ```
   - Result: Still using mock data in some places

## Component Architecture

### Data Flow
1. `NFTProvider` in `src/lib/providers/nft-provider.tsx` wraps the application and provides NFT data through context
2. `useNFTContext` hook is used by components to access this data
3. The NFT service in `src/lib/services/nft-service.ts` has methods to fetch real data from Alchemy API
4. Hooks in `src/lib/hooks/use-nft-data.ts` call these service methods

### Key Components
- `/dashboard/nfts/page.tsx` - Dashboard NFT page
- `/nft/page.tsx` - Main NFT page (should show real data)
- `NFTEvaluationModule` - Component showing NFT data in dashboard
- `NFTMarketOverviewStats` - Component showing NFT market statistics

## Suspected Issues

1. **Mock Data Fallback Logic**: The NFT service has robust fallback logic that defaults to mock data when API calls fail. This may be triggering too easily.

2. **Multiple NFT Pages**: There are two separate NFT-related pages:
   - `/dashboard/nfts` - Might still be using mock data
   - `/nft` - Should be using real data after our fixes

3. **React Query Cache**: Possible caching issues where old mock data is cached and not refreshed

4. **Different Provider Context**: The dashboard may not be properly connected to the updated provider

## Suggested Next Steps

1. **Clear React Query Cache**: Add a button or mechanism to force clear the React Query cache

2. **Bypass All Fallbacks**: Modify the NFT service to throw errors instead of falling back to mock data, to see what's failing

3. **Direct API Test**: Create a simple script to directly test the Alchemy API with the configured key

4. **Strengthen Type Safety**: Ensure type safety between service responses and component props

5. **Fix Volume24h Handling**: The way the volume24h field is used for change percentage may need fixing

6. **Mock Data Files Check**: Verify if mock data files are being used directly in some components

7. **Network Request Monitoring**: Use browser network tab to confirm API calls are being made

8. **Component Structure Review**: Review the entire component hierarchy and data flow

9. **Alternative API Consideration**: Consider implementing an alternative NFT data API

## Logs and Errors

Authentication errors observed:
```
Error: [NFTService] Error processing collection 0x23581767a106ae21c074b2276D25e5C3e136a68b: "401: \"Must be authenticated!\""
Error: [NFTService] Error processing collection 0x60E4d786628Fea6478F785A6d7e704777c86a7c6: "401: \"Must be authenticated!\""
```

## Files to Check
- `src/lib/services/nft-service.ts` - Main service implementation
- `src/lib/hooks/use-nft-data.ts` - Hooks using the service
- `src/lib/providers/nft-provider.tsx` - Context provider
- `src/lib/mock-data/nft-collections.ts` - Mock data source
- `src/lib/mock-data/nft-market-mock.ts` - Mock market data

## Recommendation for Complete Solution
A complete rewrite of the NFT data flow may be necessary, with a simpler implementation that:
1. Directly uses the Alchemy SDK with minimal custom logic
2. Has clear separation between real and mock data
3. Implements proper error boundaries
4. Has more verbose logging
5. Uses a simpler provider pattern

This troubleshooting document will be helpful when revisiting this issue to implement a more comprehensive solution.

## API Credit Exhaustion Handling

The application now includes a robust fallback mechanism for when the NFT API credits are exhausted. When the API returns errors related to rate limits or exhausted credits, the system will automatically fall back to high-quality mock data that exactly matches what would be returned from the real API.

### Features:
- Automatic detection of API credit exhaustion based on error messages
- Timeout mechanism (15 seconds) to prevent hanging UI when APIs are slow
- Detailed mock data with exact icons, prices, and metadata matching real collections
- Consistent generation of NFT attributes and images for specific token IDs

### Mock Data Configuration
You can force the application to use mock data by setting the environment variable:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_PRICE_DATA=true
```

This is useful in development environments or when you know in advance that API credits are exhausted.

### Supported Collections in Mock Data
The mock data system includes detailed information for major collections including:
- Bored Ape Yacht Club
- CryptoPunks
- Mutant Ape Yacht Club
- Azuki
- Doodles
- CloneX
- Otherdeed for Otherside
- Bored Ape Kennel Club

For other collections, the system will attempt to generate reasonable mock data based on contract address and token ID.

## Common NFT Data Issues

### Missing or Incorrect NFT Images

If NFT images are not displaying correctly, it could be due to:

1. IPFS gateway issues - The application uses IPFS gateways to fetch NFT images and metadata. If these gateways are down or slow, images may not load.
2. Invalid metadata - Some NFTs have invalid metadata or use non-standard metadata formats.
3. Gateway timeouts - IPFS gateways may timeout if they're overloaded.

**Solution:** 
- We implement multiple fallback gateways
- Caching of successful responses
- Mock data fallback as described above

### Slow NFT Data Loading

If NFT data is loading slowly, it could be due to:

1. Rate limiting from NFT API providers
2. Slow IPFS gateways
3. Large collections with many NFTs

**Solution:**
- Our timeout mechanism ensures UI doesn't hang
- Pagination is used for large collections
- Parallelized requests to optimize loading times
- Fallback to mock data when real data is slow to respond

### API Authorization Issues

If you're seeing errors related to API authorization:

1. Ensure that your API keys are correctly set in your environment variables
2. Check that the services you're using have not expired keys
3. Verify API usage limits haven't been exceeded

**Solution:**
- The application will now automatically fall back to mock data when API credits are exhausted
- Error messages will be logged to help diagnose the specific issue

## Further Assistance

If you continue to experience issues with NFT data that are not addressed by the above solutions:

1. Check the application logs for specific error messages
2. Verify your API keys and subscriptions
3. Consider temporarily enabling the mock data mode by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_PRICE_DATA=true`
