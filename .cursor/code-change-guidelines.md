# Code Change Guidelines

## When to Check Context
Before making any code changes, always check the context for:

1. Component Changes:
   - Component structure and hierarchy
   - State management patterns
   - Props and interfaces
   - Styling conventions

2. API and Data Layer:
   - API route structure
   - Database schema patterns
   - Data fetching methods
   - Error handling patterns

3. Authentication & Security:
   - Auth implementation details
   - Security measures
   - API key handling
   - Session management

4. UI/UX Patterns:
   - Layout structures
   - Navigation patterns
   - Form handling
   - Error display conventions

5. State Management:
   - Provider patterns
   - Context usage
   - State update methods
   - Data flow patterns

## Steps for Making Changes
1. First consult context for existing patterns
2. Follow established conventions
3. Maintain consistency with existing code
4. Preserve current architecture
5. Use matching naming conventions

## Important Reminders
- Always check context before creating new components
- Maintain consistent error handling
- Follow established state management patterns
