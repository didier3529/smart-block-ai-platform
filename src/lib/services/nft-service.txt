NFT MODULE DEBUGGING GUIDE:

If you're still not seeing NFT collections, check the following:

1. Verify your environment variables:
   - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_PRICE_DATA=true in .env.local to guarantee mock data is used
   - Redeploy after setting this

2. Check browser console logs for:
   - "[getNftCollections] Starting to fetch NFT collections..." - confirms function is called
   - "[createCollectionsFromMockData] Created 5 collections" - confirms mock data generation
   - "[NFTProvider] Fetched collections: {collections: [...]}" - confirms provider receives data

3. Verify NFT provider is initialized:
   - Make sure <NFTProvider> wraps your components correctly
   - Check useNFTContext() hook is used properly

4. Verify mock data structure:
   - Mock data must have trending/top collections to create proper objects
   - Backup collections should guarantee at least 5 collections

5. Clear your browser cache or try incognito mode to rule out caching issues

When running LOCALLY:
- The mock data should ALWAYS work even without API keys
- If it's not working locally, there might be a code error in the nft-provider.tsx component

For quick fix: 
- Add ?forceRefresh=true to your localhost URL to bypass React Query cache
- Or press Ctrl+F5 to do a hard refresh
